(Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol. Glyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars. Plant cells contain many different types of peroxisomes that play a role in metabolism, pathogene defense, and stress response, to mention a few.`;

export const eukaryoticCellTopicsExp = `Topic 1: What are three key characteristics that differentiate eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells?
Fact 1.1: Eukaryotic cells have a membrane-bound nucleus.
Fact 1.2: Eukaryotic cells contain numerous membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.
Fact 1.3: Eukaryotic cells possess several, rod-shaped chromosomes.

Topic 8: What is the function of peroxisomes in cells and how do they prevent damage from hydrogen peroxide?
Fact 8.1: Peroxisomes conduct oxidation reactions that decompose fatty acids and amino acids, and neutralize toxins.
Fact 8.2: They prevent cellular damage from hydrogen peroxide (a byproduct of these reactions) by breaking it down into oxygen and water through enzymatic action.`;
