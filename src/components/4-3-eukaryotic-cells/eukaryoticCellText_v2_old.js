  Describe the structure of eukaryotic cells

  Summarize the functions of the major cell organelles

“Form follows function” is a philosophy that many industries follow. In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities housed within them. For example, a skyscraper should include several elevator banks. A hospital should have an easily accessible emergency room.

Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology, as we can see with eukaryotic cell structure. Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells each have: 1) a membrane-bound nucleus; 2) numerous membrane-bound organelles; and 3) several, rod-shaped chromosomes. Because a membrane surrounds eukaryotic cell’s nucleus, it has a “true nucleus”. The word “organelle” means “little organ”, and, as we already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as your body's organs have specialized functions.

At this point, it should be clear to you that a eukaryotic cell has a more complex structure than a prokaryotic cell. Organelles allow different functions to be compartmentalized in distinct areas of the cell. In this section, we will discuss organelles found in all types of eukaryotic cells, with the exception of those that comprise the endomembrane system (the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vesicles) which collectively traffic materials through the cell; these will be discussed separately in the next lesson.

Before turning to organelles, let’s first examine two important components of the cell: the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.


The Plasma Membrane

Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells each have a plasma membrane (Figure 1), a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins that separates the internal contents of the cell from its surroundings. A phospholipid is a lipid molecule with two fatty acid chains and a phosphate-containing group. The plasma membrane controls the passage of organic molecules, ions, water, and oxygen into and out of the cell. Wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the cell by passing through the plasma membrane.

The plasma membranes of cells that specialize in absorption fold into fingerlike projections that we call microvilli (singular = microvillus); (Figure 2). Such cells typically line the small intestine, the organ that absorbs nutrients from digested food. This is an excellent example of form following function. People with celiac disease have an immune response to gluten, which is a protein in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune response damages microvilli, impairing nutrient absorption in afflicted individuals. This leads to malnutrition, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet.


The Cytoplasm

The cytoplasm is the cell's entire region between the plasma membrane and the nuclear envelope. It is comprised of organelles suspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals. Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70-80% water, it has a semi-solid consistency, due to the proteins within it. The cytoplasm also contains glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol. Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements also dissolve in the cytoplasm. Many metabolic reactions, including protein synthesis, take place in the cytoplasm.


The Nucleus

Typically, the nucleus is the most prominent organelle in a cell (Figure 3). The nucleus (plural = nuclei) houses the cell’s DNA and directs the synthesis of ribosomes and proteins. The nucleus is surrounded by a double-membrane structure called the nuclear envelope which contains pores that control the passage of ions, molecules, and RNA between the nucleoplasm (the semi-solid fluid inside the nucleus) and cytoplasm.


Chromatin and Chromosomes

Chromosomes are structures within the nucleus that are made up of DNA, the hereditary material. In eukaryotes, chromosomes are linear. Every eukaryotic species has a specific number of chromosomes in their nuclei. For example, in humans, their chromosome number is 46, while in fruit flies, it is eight. Chromosomes are only visible as the cell prepares to divide. At all other times of a cell’s life cycle, proteins attach to chromosomes, and they resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads, which we call chromatin (Figure 4). Chromatin describes these protein-chromosome complexes both when condensed and decondensed.


The Nucleolus

We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly staining area within the nucleus called the nucleolus (plural = nucleoli) aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported out through the nuclear envelope’s pores to the cytoplasm.


Ribosomes

Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They may group together into clusters (polyribosomes) or individual ribosomes may float freely in the cytoplasm. They may be attached to the plasma membrane's cytoplasmic side or the endoplasmic reticulum's cytoplasmic side and the nuclear envelope's outer membrane. They are large protein and RNA complexes, each consisting of two subunits, large and small (Figure 5). Ribosomes receive their “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.

Because proteins have a wide variety of essential cellular functions (including as enzymes, hormones, antibodies, pigments, structural components, and surface receptors), ribosomes are in every cell. Ribosomes are particularly abundant in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein. For example, the pancreas creates several digestive enzymes, and the cells that produce these enzymes contain many ribosomes. Thus, we see another example of form following function.


Mitochondria

Mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are bean-shaped structures each with a double membrane that are often called “powerhouses” of cells because they make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP represents the cell's short-term stored energy. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as waste. In fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct.

In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to note that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body moving. When your cells don’t get enough oxygen, they make small amounts of ATP and also produce lactic acid.


Peroxisomes

Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol.`;
