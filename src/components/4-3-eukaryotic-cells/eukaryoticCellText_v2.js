export const eukaryoticCellText = `“Form follows function” is a principle that many industries follow. In architecture, this principle implies that buildings should be constructed to support the activities housed within them. For example, a skyscraper should include several elevator banks. A hospital should have an easily accessible emergency room.

Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology. The structure of cell organelles evolved to support their specialized functions. Similar to how organs in your body function, each organelle is a specialized compartment inside the cell with a unique role to perform. For example, in the pancreas there are cells that are responsible for producing digestive enzymes, which are specific types of proteins that help with food digestion. In these pancreas cells, ribosomes - the organelles responsible for protein synthesis - are found in high numbers. This illustrates the principle of form following function: The form (high number of ribosomes) follows the function (protein production). In addition to ribosomes, cells contain many other organelles, each with its distinct function. Throughout this lesson, we'll explore several of these organelles and understand how their specific form supports their function.


Ribosomes

Ribosomes are the cell organelles responsible for protein synthesis. Inside the cell, ribosomes may group together into clusters (polyribosomes) or individual ribosomes may float freely in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are large protein and RNA complexes, each consisting of two subunits, one large and one small (Figure 1). Ribosomes receive their “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus that starts the process by transcribing the DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA). After transcription, the mRNA exits the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes located in the cytoplasm. The ribosomes then translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids linked together to form proteins. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are vital for various cellular functions (e.g., digestion).


Mitochondria

Mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are bean-shaped structures each with a double membrane. Mitochondria are often called “powerhouses” of cells because they make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP represents the cell's short-term stored energy. Mitochondria conduct cellular respiration, which is the process that makes ATP using the chemical energy contained in nutrients such as glucose. The cellular respiration process takes in oxygen to break down glucose and outputs ATP plus the side products carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). In fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct.

In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to note that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body moving. When your cells don’t get enough oxygen, they make small amounts of ATP and also produce lactic acid.


Peroxisomes

Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids, which are vital for various cellular functions. Oxidation reactions are also crucial in detoxifying poisons that may enter the body. Notably, many of these oxidation reactions produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a substance that can be damaging to cells. However, these reactions are safely confined inside the peroxisomes by its membrane. Within the peroxisomes, enzymes break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water, mitigating potential damage. In liver cells, peroxisomes are particularly important as they detoxify alcohol. Another significant detoxification reaction carried out by peroxisomes involves the breakdown of environmental toxins like formaldehyde, commonly found in various household products and known for its harmful effects on human health.`;

    question: "Explain the principle of “form follows function”, providing one example of how this principle applies to the structure and organization of eukaryotic cells.",
    solution: "The principle of form follows function means that the function of a particular structure is specifically designed to help the structure carry out its particular function. There are many examples where a type of eukaryotic cell is enriched in a particular structure or organelle to optimize its ability to perform a particular function. These include:  (A)	Cells that need to make a lot of proteins, like pancreatic cells that make a high quantity of digestive enzymes, contain many ribosomes, the structure responsible for protein synthesis.  (B) Muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria in order to make high amounts of ATP (the cell’s short-term stored energy) to keep your body moving."

    question: "What are ribosomes composed of, where in the cell are they used and what function are they used for? What provides them with the instructions for their function?",
    solution: "Each ribosome is composed of two subunits, a large and a small, each of which contains both proteins and RNA. Ribosomes may group as clusters or remain individual ribosomes that freely float in the cytoplasm. Additionally, ribosomes may also attach to the cytoplasmic side of the endoplasmic reticulum or the nuclear envelope’s outer membrane. They are used for linking amino acids together in a particular order to make proteins, using the information within mRNA (which is made using DNA in the nucleus) to direct the identity and order of amino acids in the protein."
  }, {
    question: "How does the act of breathing support cellular respiration in eukaryotic cells, what are the key inputs and outputs of this cellular process and where in the cell does it occur?",
    solution: "In breathing, the body takes in oxygen during inhalation and releases carbon dioxide during exhalation. This is related to cellular respiration, which uses oxygen to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a form of short-term energy storage, and produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. Thus, breathing provides the oxygen that the body’s cells need for cellular respiration and removes the carbon dioxide they produce as waste. In eukaryotic cells, cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria."

    question: "What is the importance of peroxisomes and how would their absence or reduction affect an organism?",
    solution: "Peroxisomes carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol. Their absence or reduction would lead to death of the organism."
