0fb0c505	teacher-qa-bot	('RNA', 'translation')			('Glucose', 'ATP')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			"Form follows function" is a principle that says the shape of a cell is determined by the purpose of the cell. For example, muscle cells are shaped as such because they are responsible for the movement of the body through contractions.			The structure of pancreas cells supports their function by clustering together and surrounding a central lumen. They then secrete digestive enzymes necessary for the digestion process.			The cell is not damaged by H2O2 because before it can become harmful it is broken down and disposed of by an enzyme called catalase. The residual products of the disposal process are water and oxygen.

8bf22c8f	teacher-qa-bot	('RNA', 'amino acid')			('H2O2', 'N/A')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			Form follows function means that the function of a particular structure is specifically designed to help the structure carry out its specific function.			They supply it with protein which travels to the ribosomes which later become amino acids.			The cell is not damaged mainly because of oxidation, which could normally damage it, however, the reactions are confined to peroxisomes which safely breakdown hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.		
cf1d00f8	teacher-qa-bot	('RNA', 'I have no earthly idea')			('???', '???')			('peroxisomes', 'cellular respiration')			Form follows function means that something is composed in a way that aids its purpose/function. 			Digestive pancreas cells have higher amounts of the one cell part that makes proteins? 			The cell isn't damaged by H202 because peroxisomes break it down during cellular respiration, maybe? I'm trying so hard to remember these, you have no idea. 		
ede3330d	teacher-qa-bot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('glucose', 'ATP')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			Muscle cells have large numbers of mitochondria which can create ATP and lactic acid to keep a body moving if the muscle cells run out of oxygen. Lactic acid buildup is the cause of muscle soreness after a hard workout.			RIbosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis, occur in large numbers in the pancreas. The panceas is responsible for creating digestive enzymes to digest food, which often contains large amounts of protein. THerefore, the ribosomes support the digestion of proteins.

They contain lots of mitocondria. When the cells don't get enough oxygen, they need to produce ATP and in the process lactic acid is also produced.			They support their digestive function through high numbers of ribosomes which are responsible for protein synthesis			Cells are not damaged because the oxidation process is handled inside of the peroxisomes located within the cells. The peroxisome produce enzymes that break down the hydrogen peroxide into simple water and oxygen which is harmless.		
68e019b0	llm-qa-bot	('mRNA', 'proteins')			('hydrogen', 'oxygen')			('cells', 'energy')			Form follows functions means that the structure of something is able to contain the actions performed within it.  Muscle cells for example need a lot of energy and therefore are able to contain the ribosomes that process protein.			The structure of pancreas cells contain a certain thing I can't remember the name of that helps detoxify cells in the body by breaking down poisons with enzymes into non-toxic things.			There is something which I can't remember that uses enzymes to break down the hydrogen peroxide into the residual products of water and oxygen.		
a5963840	llm-qa-bot	('I forget', 'proteins?')			('ribosomes', 'nuclei')			('ribosomes', '???')			the ribosomes distribute energy into fatty acids which is transferred into the muscle cells.			Water and oxygen compounds are broken down and turned into amino acids.			It detoxifies the cell and turns the H202 into H20. i forgot the rest.

cbfc7b97	llm-qa-bot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('hydrogen', 'N/A')			('peroxisomes', 'chemical')			Form follows function means that the structure of cells are influenced by the function those cells carry out. Muscle cells require a lot of energy to move the body, so they are structured with a high concentration of mitochondria, which create ATP, which stores energy.			The digestive pancreas has many peroxisomes, which detoxify the body and break down fatty and amino acids.			The cell is not damaged by hydrogen peroxide because enzymes break it down into water and oxygen.		
118d9807	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('glucose ', 'ATP')			('enzymes', 'chemical ')			The structure of cell component and organelles is directly related to their function.  			they make hormones that regulate blood sugar and regulate pancreatic secretions			Enzymes protect the cell from H202 damage.

2e83a5c0	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('glucose', 'oxygen')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			The structure and function of muscle cells are directly related to their function. We need lots of energy, so muscle cells have lots of mitochondria.			Digestive pancreas cells have peroxisomes to help converting stored fats into sugars in the digestive process.			The cells aren't damaged by H202 because they have a process of carrying out oxidation reactions that break down h202 into oxygen and water.		
31024d4f	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('glucose', 'carbon dioxide')			('peroxisomes', 'chemical')			"Form follows function" essentially means that the structure of certain organelles is related to their intended purpose. For example, muscle cells contain many mitochondria, as these organelles make ATP, and muscles need a lot of energy in the form of ATP to move our bodies.			I am not sure how to answer this since I don't remember it being covered in the lesson and I don't know/remember it. I would guess these digestive cells contain a lot of a certain type of organelle that is responsible for converting nutrients from food into things our body can use, so possibly many mitochondria to make ATP from food.			The cell is not damaged by H2O2 because peroxisomes break it down and dispose of it by using enzymes to chemically turn it into its constituent materials of water and oxygen.		
6045e17c	llm-chatbot	('cells', 'protein synthesis')			('energy', 'glucose')			('peroxixomes', 'detoxing')			This is a function of many cells that work together and then they support each other.  Many cells work with the blood cells in the muscles and you have the form follows functions.  It happens all over in your body all the time.			The cells in the pancreas are mainly there to help detoxify your body.  The cells are peroxisomes which have single membranes that the "poison" goes in and is taken care of.  They are small, round organelles.			The cells that take care of them are peroxisomes and they ''eat'' the H2O2.  It goes into a single membrane that surrounds the cell.  The cell then disposes of them in the form of carbon dioxide.		
8fd60a4f	llm-chatbot	('mrna', 'amino acids')			('glucose', 'protein')			('glucose', 'respiration')			the purpose of a cell is determined by how it is formed			idk			idk		
976467b3	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('glucose', 'ATP')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			"Form follows functions" means that the structure of the insides of cells is unique to each type of cell based on their "job" in the body. For example, muscle cells require a large amount of energy in the form of ATP, and mitochondria produce ATP. Because muscles need more energy, muscle cells have more mitochondria to meet that need. 			Digestion requires breaking down nutrients into materials cells can use to perform their functions. Amino and fatty acids must be broken down by peroxisomes, so it follows that cells involved in digestion would have more peroxisomes than other cells in the body. 			Cells are not damaged by the H2O2 waste product of the oxidation process of peroxisomes because the H2O2 is contained in the membrane of the peroxisomes. The H2O2 is further broken down by enzymes inside peroxisomes into oxygen and water. 		
a312b58a	llm-chatbot	('ATP', 'protein')			('ribosome', 'ATP')			('water', 'sythensis')			it applies that this must happen in order to produce muscle cells			they help the body digest the food that is in the stomach			ribosomes carry the H202 to different cells to get disposed of		
ab8cfe7f	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('glucose', 'ATP')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidative')			Form follows function is when the structure of a cell is determined by the function it provides. This applies to muscle cells because muscle cells require a constant source of ATP in order to fulfill the function of making the body move. Because of this, a high concentration of mitochondria is needed in these cells because mitochondria produce ATP, the primary energy-carrying molecule of the cell. Without this energy source, the muscle cells cannot function effectively.			The pancreas cells contain peroxisomes which are able to break down fatty acids, amino acids, and toxins through oxidative reactions. The pancreas itself helps in digestion which requires the breaking down of molecules using enzymes. This process is aided by the presence of peroxisomes in pancreas cells because of the ability of peroxisomes to break down certain molecules.			The cell is not damaged by the hydrogen peroxide provided that it is contained within the peroxisome. The organelle has a membrane that prevents the hydrogen peroxide from affecting the rest of the cell. The hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water and oxygen within the organelle.		
b58ac506	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('Protein', 'ATP')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			Structure is directly related to cellular function. Mitochondria will be found in high numbers in muscle cells since they make ATP and muscle cells require constant energy to keep body moving.			Peroxisomes, small round organelles, will be found in higher numbers in areas that require breakdown of fatty and amino acids and or require detoxification for the body.			The peroxisomes confine reaction and the enzymes further breakdown H202 into oxygen and water to be released.		
c7ee9e38	llm-chatbot	('RNA', 'trna')			('carbon + hydrogen', 'oxygen')			('breaking down', 'chemical')			breaking down to build up			this was too confusing			there are protections		
e8749e69	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('carbon', 'oxygen')			('perixomes', 'chemical')			It means that the form of different parts of the body are designed a certain way to correctly do certain things. Certain cells are designed perfectly to carry out different roles in the body and do what needs to be done.			They contain all of what they need to break down things that could be toxic to the rest of the body.			It is contained by peroxisomes and kept away from other parts of the body that it could hurt. It is safely broken down into  Oxygen and Water.		
e87b34a5	llm-chatbot	('RNA', 'sequencing')			('carbon', 'sugar')			('peroxisomes ', 'cellular respiration')			Form follows functions mean that the main thing that is functioning comes from smaller functions inside that work together. The muscle cells have different processes going on inside that make your muscles work properly.			The structure of the digestive pancreas cells support their particular function by oxidation reactions that are confined in the peroxisomes. 			The cell is not damaged by H2O2 because it is confined in the peroxisomes so it releases oxygen and water.		
fd93f340	llm-chatbot	('MRNA', 'instructions')			('Nitrogen', 'ATP')			('organelles', 'respiration')			If something is useful to a structure, it's likely to exist in the structure. For example muscle cells have more mitochondria, because those aid in muscle use.			No clue.			I don't know.
