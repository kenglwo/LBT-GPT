For example, muscle cells require a large amount of energy in the form of ATP, and mitochondria produce ATP. Because muscles need more energy, muscle cells have more mitochondria to meet that need. 			Digestion requires breaking down nutrients into materials cells can use to perform their functions. Amino and fatty acids must be broken down by peroxisomes, so it follows that cells involved in digestion would have more peroxisomes than other cells in the body. 			Cells are not damaged by the H2O2 waste product of the oxidation process of peroxisomes because the H2O2 is contained in the membrane of the peroxisomes.

For example, muscle cells have very high concentration of mitochondria. This is because they require a high amount of energy to keep the body mobile, and the cells main source of energy, ATP, is made by mitochondria. In this case, the form (muscles containing high number of mitochondria) follows the function (muscles needing energy; mitochondria producing ATP).			The pancreas contains a high number of ribosomes. This is because the pancreas requires a large amount of digestive enzymes, and ribosomes synthesize these enzymes from mRNA. In this case, the structure of the pancreas (containing many ribosomes) helps it perform its main function by providing the necessary proteins.			In the cell oxidation reaction takes place inside single-membraned organelles called peroxisomes. A byproduct of this reaction is H2O2, which would normally be harmful to the cell, but is safely contained within the peroxisome. The peroxisome breaks the H2O2 down into oxygen and water.

This applies to muscle cells because muscle cells require a constant source of ATP in order to fulfill the function of making the body move. Because of this, a high concentration of mitochondria is needed in these cells because mitochondria produce ATP, the primary energy-carrying molecule of the cell. Without this energy source, the muscle cells cannot function effectively.			The pancreas cells contain peroxisomes which are able to break down fatty acids, amino acids, and toxins through oxidative reactions. The pancreas itself helps in digestion which requires the breaking down of molecules using enzymes. This process is aided by the presence of peroxisomes in pancreas cells because of the ability of peroxisomes to break down certain molecules.			The cell is not damaged by the hydrogen peroxide provided that it is contained within the peroxisome. The organelle has a membrane that prevents the hydrogen peroxide from affecting the rest of the cell. The hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water and oxygen within the organelle.

The text gave the example of how an emergency room in a hospital must have easy access due to the need to transport patients directly and efficiently. The function, getting patients in and out quickly, shapes its form, having a clear and unobstructed path. When applying this principle to muscle cells, consider that muscle cells require much more energy than other cells in order to move. As a consequence muscle cells have a higher amount of mitochondria present in them (form) due to their need for ATP (function).			Since pancreas cells have the specialized task of creating proteins, they have much more ribosomes, the organelles that synthesize protein, than other cells. This is analogous to how muscle cells have more mitochondria than other cells.
