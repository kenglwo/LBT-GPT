Comment for teacher: Great job reaching out when you're unsure! To answer the student's question, you can explain that the mRNA, which carries the instructions for protein synthesis from the DNA in the nucleus, travels to the ribosomes located in the cytoplasm. The ribosomes then translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids linked together. These amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Keep up the good work!
Teacher (to the student): The process of protein synthesis works by first, the mRNA, which carries the instructions required by the ribosomes to start protein synthesis, traveling to the ribosomes that lay in the cell cytoplasm. Then the ribosomes translate the instructions located on the mRNA into a string of amino acids, which are the starting building blocks of proteins.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for explaining that! So, mRNA carries the instructions for protein synthesis from the nucleus to the ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm. The ribosomes then translate these instructions into a string of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. This is really interesting!

['Student (to the teacher): Hi! I\'m excited to learn from you. I\'d like to start with the phrase "form follows function" in the context of cell biology. Could you explain what it means?']
Teacher (to the student): Sure!  Before I do however; what do you think it means and don't worry about right or wrong answers here - but from the phrase itself without any context, what might this mean?
Student (to the teacher): Well, I'm not entirely sure, but I guess it could mean that the shape or structure of something is determined by its purpose or function. Is that somewhat correct in the context of cell biology?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, this idea in general, also holds in the context of cell biology as well.  Great work - now, let's take it a step further and think about an example from cell biology - consider a muscle cell which needs considerable energy to generate kinetic energy to move your body ... based on that function, could we expect the structure of the muscle cell to include numerous mitochondria?
Student (to the teacher): Oh, I see! So because muscle cells need a lot of energy, they would have many mitochondria, which are the "powerhouses" of the cell. That's a great example of "form follows function". Thank you for explaining that! 
Student (to the teacher): Could you provide another example, perhaps related to a different cell component?
Teacher (to the student): Sure, how about we look at an example directly from our text and apply what we have learned about this idea of "form follows function" to it by reading the section on "Peroxisomes".  After reading that section, can you paraphrase that information and show how it is an example of "form follows function"?
Student (to the teacher): I'm sorry for the confusion, but I don't have access to the text. I'm relying on you to teach me these concepts. Could you please explain the structure and function of peroxisomes and how it's an example of "form follows function"?
Teacher (to the student): I can give you the same information here quickly to help you, I am sorry about that.  Here is information about peroxisomes that is similar to the text: peroxisomes are small round organelles enclosed by single membranes: they carry out oxidation reactions and break down fatty acids and amino acids.  They help to detoxify poisons.  They contain and control the release of hydrogen peroxide selectively in a way to break down what is needed but not cause damage to other tissues and cells that don't need to be broken down or detoxified.  The liver cells in a human, which take part in detoxifying, breaking down, and filtering of various toxins and waste products in the human body have a lot of peroxisomes.  

With that information, you should be able to readdress the question now.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, peroxisomes are small organelles that carry out oxidation reactions and help detoxify poisons. They are abundant in liver cells, which are responsible for detoxifying and filtering toxins in our body. This is another example of "form follows function" because the high number of peroxisomes in liver cells is directly related to their function of detoxification. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could we move on to the structure and function of ribosomes in eukaryotic cells?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, can you tell me a bit more about that and how it relates to this concept of "form follows function" that we have been discussing with our other examples.  Remember, ribosomes produce proteins (protein synthesis) - considering a pancreas cell which produces numerous types of digestive-related enzymes (specialized proteins) has a high number of ribosomes, would this example also fit this idea of "form follows function"?
Student (to the teacher): I see, so because pancreas cells need to produce a lot of enzymes, which are specialized proteins, they would have many ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis. That's another example of "form follows function". Thank you for explaining that! 
Student (to the teacher): Could you tell me more about the structure of ribosomes and how they contribute to protein synthesis?
Teacher (to the student): Sure, think of the ribosome like a factory assembly line for building cars - just as different parts of a car come together on an assembly line, ribosomes bring together amino acids in a specific sequence to assemble a protein.  The "blueprints" for the car (or protein) are provided by the RNA, guiding the ribosome to add each part (amino acid) in the correct order to produce a functional car (protein).
Student (to the teacher): That's a great analogy! So, ribosomes are like assembly lines that use RNA as blueprints to assemble amino acids in a specific sequence to form a protein. 
Student (to the teacher): How does the ribosome receive these "orders" for protein synthesis?
Teacher (to the student): The ribosomes get the building instructions from something called mRNA, which is like a manual that tells them which part (amino acid) to put together and in what order.  So, the ribosomes read the mRNA manual (which is like a long sequence of specific instructions) and follow the information it provides on how to put the amino acids together properly for the type of protein that is being made.
Student (to the teacher): Ah, I see! So, the mRNA is like a manual that provides the ribosomes with the sequence of amino acids needed to assemble the protein. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could we discuss the role of mitochondria in cells and why they are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of cells?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, this is because they provide energy or "power" and the "house" or structure that does this is the mitochondria!  Pretty cool, huh?  It seems like you understand the material very well and have done wonderful in our discussions - I believe you are ready to begin the test, if you feel you are ready!
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the compliment! But I'd like to understand a bit more about mitochondria. Could you explain how they make ATP, the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule?
Teacher (to the student): We will get into that after this lesson in more detail; however, I can give you some materials and some stuff to look at to get ready for that and since you are interested which is awesome - for now though I can give you the big picture idea of what happens, but do understand we will get into greater detail about the specifics of each step in the lessons that follow.  The big idea is this - mitochondria use a variety of chemical reactions and processes in order to take complex sugar molecules and harvest the energy contained in the breaking of the bonds in those molecules as they break down into simpler molecules.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the overview! So, mitochondria use chemical reactions to break down complex sugar molecules and harvest the energy from those reactions to create ATP. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain a bit more about the process of cellular respiration in mitochondria?
Teacher (to the student): Sure, after our test I can because it gets deep (glycolysis, anaerobic versus aerobic, Krebs' cycle, electron transport chain ... ) so much good to come!  But, for today, I think you are set to pass this test with flying colors!
Student (to the teacher): I appreciate your confidence in me! But I'd really like to understand a bit more about cellular respiration in mitochondria before we move on. Could you give me a brief overview? I'd be thrilled if you could check it and get back to me.
Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria are often called the powerhouse of the cell and do this through three main states: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.  In these stages, glucose and oxygen are converted into carbon dioxide, water, and ATP.  The bulk of the ATP production occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria, where a series of enzyme-driven reactions create an electrical gradient that ultimately powers the synthesis of ATP.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, mitochondria convert glucose and oxygen into carbon dioxide, water, and ATP through three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The majority of ATP production happens in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could we discuss how the concentration of mitochondria in muscle cells relates to the principle of "form follows function"?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, if muscle cells need to produce energy to move things and mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell that provides mechanisms for producing energy - would you agree this fits the idea of "form follows function"?
Student (to the teacher): Yes, I see! So, muscle cells have a high concentration of mitochondria because they need a lot of energy to function. This is another example of "form follows function". 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain a bit more about why muscle cells require such a high energy requirement?
Teacher (to the student): Sure, what do muscles have to do (i.e. what is their function?)
Student (to the teacher): Muscles are responsible for movement, so I guess they would need a lot of energy to contract and relax. Is that why they have a high concentration of mitochondria?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, exactly - kinetic energy is energy of movement - the key word being "energy" - so yes you are correct in your explanation and reasoning!
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for confirming that! So, the high concentration of mitochondria in muscle cells is directly related to their function of movement, which requires a lot of energy. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could we discuss peroxisomes and their functions in cells? How do they contribute to the detoxification process in the body?
Teacher (to the student): They use hydrogen peroxide to break down various chemicals such as toxins.
Student (to the teacher): I see, so peroxisomes use hydrogen peroxide to break down various chemicals, including toxins. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain how they break down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, they use enzymes in order to take hydrogen peroxide and break it down into oxygen and water in a controlled and safe manner for the rest of the cells and tissues in the body that aren't toxic or need to be destroyed.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, peroxisomes use enzymes to safely break down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you provide an example of how peroxisomes contribute to the detoxification process in the body, perhaps in relation to a specific organ?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, the liver which filters toxins in the human body contains numerous peroxisomes to help achieve detoxification.
Student (to the teacher): Ah, I see! So, the liver, which is responsible for filtering toxins, contains many peroxisomes that aid in this detoxification process. That's a great example of "form follows function". 
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for all your explanations! I've asked all the questions I wanted to learn.
Teacher (to the student): Awesome, before we begin the test, can you tell me one thing you learned today and one question you have about what is to come?
Student (to the teacher): Sure! One thing I learned today is the principle of "form follows function" in cell biology. I now understand that the structure of a cell or its components is directly related to its function. For example, muscle cells have a high concentration of mitochondria because they require a lot of energy for movement. As for a question about what's to come, I'm curious to learn more about other cell organelles and how their structure and function contribute to the overall functioning of the cell.
Teacher (to the student): Excellent question and excited to continue investigating that in the future with you!  Great work today and excellent overview of the conversation and material.  I think you are ready for the test!  If you feel ready, we can begin!

Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your kind words and for all your help today! I feel much more prepared now. I'm ready to take the test!

Teacher (to the student): Hi Ruffle, I am happy to teach you! What would you like to learn about?
['Student (to the teacher): Hi! I\'m excited to learn from you. I\'d like to start with the phrase "form follows function" in the context of cell biology. Could you explain what it means?']
Teacher (to the student): it is a philosophy that many industries follow. The structure of cell components and organelles is directly related to their function.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, if I understand correctly, the structure of a cell or its components is designed in a way that allows it to perform its function effectively. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you provide an example to illustrate this concept, perhaps something related to ribosomes in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein?
Teacher (to the student): For example, ribosomes, the organelles responsible protein synthesis are found in high numbers in eukaryotic cells that synthesize large amounts of protein such as those in the pancreas that produce digestive enzymes.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the example! So, the high number of ribosomes in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein is a perfect illustration of the "form follows function" concept. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could you describe the structure and function of these ribosomes in more detail?
Teacher (to the student): Here the form (high number of ribosomes) follows the function (protein synthesis).
Student (to the teacher): I see, so the high number of ribosomes in these cells is directly related to their function of protein synthesis. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you tell me more about the structure of ribosomes and how they contribute to protein synthesis?
Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They may group together into clusters or individual ribosomes may float freely in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes receive their orders for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, ribosomes are large protein and RNA complexes that can either group together or float freely in the cytoplasm. They receive orders for protein synthesis from the nucleus via messenger RNA. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain how the process of protein synthesis works, particularly the role of mRNA in this process?
Teacher (to the student): The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids link together.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the detailed explanation! So, mRNA carries the code from the nucleus to the ribosomes, which then translate this code into a specific order of amino acids to form proteins. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could we move on to the role of mitochondria in cells? Why are they often referred to as the "powerhouses" of cells?
Teacher (to the student): The mitochondria is the cell's main energy-carrying molecule. They make adenosine triphosphate which is the cell's short -term stored energy.
Teacher (to the student): mitochondria makes adenosine triphosphate which in the cells' short term energy.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your answer! So, mitochondria are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of cells because they produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides short-term energy for the cells. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain how mitochondria use the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients to make ATP?
Teacher (to the student): cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in glucose and other nutruents.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, mitochondria use a process called cellular respiration to convert the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients into ATP.

Student (to the teacher): Now, could we discuss how the concentration of mitochondria in muscle cells relates to the principle of "form follows function"?
Teacher (to the student): muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce atp. the muscle cells need considerable energy to keep the body moving. when the cells don't get enough oxygen they make a small amount of atp and lactic acid.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, muscle cells have a high concentration of mitochondria due to their high energy requirement. This is another example of the "form follows function" principle.

Teacher (to the student): they carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. they also detoxify many poisons that enter the body.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your answer! So, peroxisomes carry out oxidation reactions to break down fatty acids and amino acids, and they also play a role in detoxifying many poisons that enter the body.

Teacher (to the student): Hi Ruffle, I am happy to teach you! What would you like to learn about?
["Student (to the teacher): Hi! I'm excited to learn from you. Could you please explain to me what the phrase ''form follows function'' means in the context of cell biology?"]
Teacher (to the student): Sure! This means that the way cells are structured matches up with the function that cell carries out
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, if I understand correctly, the structure of a cell or its components is directly related to its function. Could you please provide an example to illustrate this concept? 
Teacher (to the student): Yes! So let's talk about an organelle called a "ribosome." Ribosomes handle protein synthesis. So, a cell that synthesizes a lot of protein, like eukaryotic cells, have a lot of ribosomes. The form of the cell (having a lot of the protein-synthesizing ribosomes) follows its function (synthesizing proteins). It's like having the right specialized workers to do a job.
Student (to the teacher): That's a great example, thank you! So, ribosomes in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein is a perfect illustration of the ''form follows function'' principle. Now, could you please describe the structure and function of ribosomes in more detail? 
Teacher (to the student): Sure. Ribosomes are large protein and RNA complexes, and they have two "subunits" - one large unit, and one small. (Imagine two units in the same office.) The ribosome gets "orders" for protein synthesis from the nucleus, where DNA transcribes into messenger RNA (mRNA). The ribosomes can then "translate" that mRNA into a specific order of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the detailed explanation! So, ribosomes are large protein and RNA complexes that receive “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus. The mRNA then travels to the ribosomes for translation into a specific order of amino acids. This is fascinating! Could you now explain the role of mitochondria in cells? 
Teacher (to the student): Yes! You've probably heard of mitochondria as the "powerhouses" of the cell. This is because they make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the cell's main energy-carrying molecule. (ATP is what's used for a cell's short-term stored energy.) Mitochondria go through cellular respiration to make ATP using oxygen as fuel and producing carbon dioxide as waste. (The reason we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide is because of cellular reactions like this that need to use oxygen as fuel and produce carbon dioxide as waste.) Remember how form follows function? Muscles need a lot of energy to keep you moving, so they a high concentration of mitochondria. 
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the clear explanation! So, mitochondria are often referred to as the ''powerhouses'' of cells because they make ATP, the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. They use chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients to make ATP through the process of cellular respiration. That's really interesting! Now, could you please explain more about the concentration of mitochondria in muscle cells and how it relates to the principle of ''form follows function''? 
Teacher (to the student): Sure. Think about all the places you need energy throughout the day. Your muscles are involved in almost all of that, right? So they have a high concentration of mitochondria so they can get the energy they need to function. The form, a lot of powerhouses, follows the function, a high need for power.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, muscle cells have a high concentration of mitochondria due to their high energy requirement. This is another great example of the ''form follows function'' principle. Now, could you please tell me about peroxisomes and what functions they perform in cells? 
Teacher (to the student): Sure! Peroxisomes break down fatty acids and amino acids via oxidation reactions. They also detoxify poisons that enter the body. (You can think of them as special containment units - for example, if an oxidation reaction that released hydrogen peroxide into your cells, the cell would be damaged. But because it's in the special containment zone of a peroxisome, it can safely get broken down into components that don't hurt the cell - in this case, oxygen and water.) In humans, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the detailed explanation! So, peroxisomes carry out oxidation reactions to break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons and break down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. The example of peroxisomes in liver cells detoxifying alcohol is really helpful. I've asked all the questions I want to learn. Thank you so much for your time and patience!

Student (to the teacher): Now, could you explain the role of mitochondria in cells and why they are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of cells?
Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria are referred to as the "powerhouse" of cells because they make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy-carrying molecule. ATP represents the cell's short-term stored energy. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as waste. In keeping with the theme of form following function, it's important to note that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body moving.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, mitochondria are known as the "powerhouses" of cells because they produce ATP, the cell's main energy-carrying molecule, through the process of cellular respiration.

They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol. Glyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, peroxisomes are small organelles that carry out oxidation reactions to break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also play a crucial role in detoxifying many poisons, like alcohol in liver cells. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain how peroxisomes break down hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water?

['Student (to the teacher): Hi! I\'m excited to learn from you. I\'d like to start with the phrase "form follows function" in the context of cell biology. Could you explain what it means?']
Teacher (to the student): Form follows function is an idea that the activity being completed should lead to the shape of the object being created. So, if you want to build a house, you should first consider who you are building it for and what they will be doing there, then design a shape around those activities.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, if I understand correctly, in cell biology, "form follows function" means that the structure of a cell or its components is designed based on what it needs to do. Is that correct? 
Student (to the teacher): Could you provide an example to illustrate this concept?
Teacher (to the student): Yes, the idea you have is correct. In cellular biology, consider the form of ribosomes. The organelles that perform protein synthesis are found in high numbers in the eukaryotic cells. This is the area that synthesizes large amounts of proteins, like in your pancreas. Therefore the form, being a lot of ribosomes, follows the function, the protein synthesis.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the clear example! So, the ribosomes, due to their function of synthesizing proteins, are found in large numbers in cells that need to produce a lot of proteins. That's a great illustration of "form follows function". 
Student (to the teacher): Could you tell me more about the structure and function of these ribosomes in eukaryotic cells?
Teacher (to the student): Eukaryotic cells have numerous other organelles, but the ribosomes within eukaryotic cells help with things like producing digestive enzymes. 
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the information! So, ribosomes in eukaryotic cells help produce enzymes, among other things. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain more about the structure of ribosomes and how they contribute to protein synthesis?
Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes receive their orders from the nucleus, where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA, or mRNA. That mRNA travels to each ribosome. Those ribosomes translate the code by the sequence of nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into an order of amino acids link together. Those amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Ribosomes may group together in clusters, called polyribosomes or float freely in the cytoplasm. 
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the detailed explanation! So, ribosomes are large protein and RNA complexes that receive "orders" for protein synthesis from the nucleus. The mRNA, which carries these orders, travels to the ribosomes where it is translated into a sequence of amino acids that form proteins. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could you explain the role of mitochondria in cells? Why are they often referred to as the "powerhouses" of cells?
Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria are bean-shaped, each having a double membrane. They get the name "powerhouses" because they make the short term stored cell's main energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, mitochondria are bean-shaped organelles with a double membrane that produce ATP, the cell's main energy-carrying molecule. That's why they're called the "powerhouses" of cells. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you explain how mitochondria use the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients to make ATP?
Teacher (to the student): ATP gets made through cellular respiration by using chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, the process uses oxygen and produced carbon dioxide as waste. Interestingly enough, as you breath out, you are expelling the carbon dioxide you make each day.  
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, mitochondria make ATP through a process called cellular respiration, which uses the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients. This process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product, which we breathe out. 
Student (to the teacher): How does the concentration of mitochondria in muscle cells relate to the principle of "form follows function"?
Teacher (to the student): The muscles in your body have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscles need a lot of energy or else you wouldn't be able to move. When your cells don't get enough oxygen, they make small amounts of ATP and produce lactic acid. 
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the explanation! So, muscle cells have a high concentration of mitochondria because they need a lot of energy, which is provided by the ATP produced by the mitochondria. This is another example of "form follows function". 
Student (to the teacher): Could you tell me about peroxisomes and what functions they perform in cells?
Teacher (to the student): Peroxisomes are also organelles, they are small and round, enclosed by a single membrane. They not only help detoxify many poisons that may enter the body, they carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty and amino acids. Much of the oxidation reactions would be harmful to your cells however due to those reactions being confined to peroxisomes, the enzymes safely break down the hydrogen peroxide by product into oxygen and water. 
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for the detailed explanation! So, peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by a single membrane. They carry out oxidation reactions to break down fatty acids and amino acids, and they also help detoxify many poisons. The potentially harmful byproduct of these reactions, hydrogen peroxide, is safely broken down into oxygen and water within the peroxisomes.

To answer the student's question, you can explain that many oxidation reactions in peroxisomes produce hydrogen peroxide, which can be harmful to cells. However, peroxisomes contain enzymes that safely break down the hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, thus preventing damage to the cell. Keep up the good work!
Teacher (to the student): Many oxidation reactions in peroxisomes produce hydrogen peroxide, which can be harmful to cells. However, peroxisomes contain enzymes that break down the hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water, which prevents damage to the cell.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, peroxisomes produce hydrogen peroxide during oxidation reactions, but they also contain enzymes that break this down into oxygen and water, preventing damage to the cell. 
Student (to the teacher): I think I've asked all the questions I wanted to learn. Thank you so much for your time and patience!
Teacher (to the student): You are welcome, Riley!
Student (to the teacher): Thank you again for all your help! I've learned so much from you.

Comment for teacher: You're doing great! To answer the student's question, you can refer to the material provided. It explains how the principle of "form follows function" applies to cell biology, with examples of how the structure of cell components and organelles is directly related to their function. Keep up the good work!
Teacher (to the student): The structure of a cell's components and organelle's are directly related to their function. For example ribosomes the organelles responsible for protein synthesis are found in eukaryotic cells that synthesize large amounts of proteins.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, "form follows function" in cell biology means that the structure of a cell or its components is designed in a way that allows it to perform its function effectively. For instance, ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis, are found in large amounts in cells that need to synthesize a lot of proteins. 
Student (to the teacher): Could you tell me more about the structure of ribosomes and how they contribute to protein synthesis?
Step 1: The teacher has asked for help, which is a good sign of their willingness to learn and improve.
Step 2: Not applicable as the teacher has not provided any information yet.
Step 3: The teacher has admitted they do not know the answer, which is a good step towards learning.

Comment for teacher: Great job reaching out when you're unsure! To answer the student's question, you can explain that ribosomes are large protein and RNA complexes, each consisting of two subunits, large and small. They receive their “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Keep up the good work!
Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes are large protein and RNA complexes each consisting of two subunits, large and small. They receive their orders for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA.
Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, ribosomes are large complexes made up of protein and RNA, and they have two subunits. They get instructions for protein synthesis from the nucleus, where DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA. 
Student (to the teacher): How does this messenger RNA interact with the ribosomes in the process of protein synthesis?
Step 1: The teacher has asked for help, which is a good sign of their willingness to learn and improve.
Step 2: The teacher has not provided any incorrect information.
Step 3: The teacher has admitted they need help, which is a positive step.

Comment for teacher: Great job on admitting when you need help! That's a sign of a great teacher. To answer the student's question, the messenger RNA (mRNA) travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids linked together. These amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Keep up the good work!

Student (to the teacher): Thank you for your explanation! So, the messenger RNA (mRNA) travels to the ribosomes, which then translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids. These amino acids are then linked together to form proteins. 
Student (to the teacher): Now, could you explain the role of mitochondria in cells and why they are often referred to as the "powerhouses" of cells?
