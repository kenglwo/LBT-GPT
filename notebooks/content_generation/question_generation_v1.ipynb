    "LESSON_TEXT = '''“Form follows function” is a philosophy that many industries follow. In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the activities housed within them. For example, a skyscraper should include several elevator banks. A hospital should have an easily accessible emergency room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our natural world also utilizes the principle of form following function, especially in cell biology. The structure of cell components and organelles is directly related to their function. For example, ribosomes, the organelles responsible for protein synthesis, are found in high numbers in eukaryotic cells that synthesize large amounts of protein, such as those in the pancreas that produce digestive enzymes. Here the form (high number of ribosomes) follows the function (protein synthesis). Apart from ribosomes, eukaryotic cells have numerous other organelles. These organelles are specialized compartments inside the cells, and similar to the organs in your body, each organelle has a unique role. In this lesson, we will dive into several examples of organelles and discuss their specific functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ribosomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ribosomes are the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They may group together into clusters (polyribosomes) or individual ribosomes may float freely in the cytoplasm. They may be attached to the plasma membrane's cytoplasmic side or the endoplasmic reticulum's cytoplasmic side and the nuclear envelope's outer membrane. They are large protein and RNA complexes, each consisting of two subunits, large and small (Figure 1). Ribosomes receive their “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids linked together. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitochondria\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitochondria (singular = mitochondrion) are bean-shaped structures each with a double membrane that are often called “powerhouses” of cells because they make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. ATP represents the cell's short-term stored energy. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as waste. In fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the cellular reactions that produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In keeping with our theme of form following function, it is important to note that muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body moving. When your cells don’t get enough oxygen, they make small amounts of ATP and also produce lactic acid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Peroxisomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. (Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol. Glyoxysomes, which are specialized peroxisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars. Plant cells contain many different types of peroxisomes that play a role in metabolism, pathogene defense, and stress response, to mention a few.'''\n"

      "    question: \"What does the phrase ''form follows function'' mean in the context of cell biology? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\",\n",
      "    solution: \"The phrase ''form follows function'' in cell biology means that the structure of cell components and organelles is directly related to their function. For example, ribosomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis, are found in high numbers in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein, such as those in the pancreas that produce digestive enzymes. Here, the form (high number of ribosomes) follows the function (protein synthesis).\",\n",
      "  },\n",
      "  {\n",
      "    question: \"Describe the structure and function of ribosomes. How do they contribute to protein synthesis?\",\n",
      "    solution: \"Ribosomes are cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. They are large protein and RNA complexes, each consisting of two subunits, large and small. Ribosomes may group together into clusters or float freely in the cytoplasm. They may also be attached to the plasma membrane's cytoplasmic side or the endoplasmic reticulum's cytoplasmic side and the nuclear envelope's outer membrane. Ribosomes receive their “orders” for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into a specific order of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.\",\n",

      "    question: \"Explain why mitochondria are often referred to as the ''powerhouses'' of cells. What is their role in energy production and how does this relate to their structure?\",\n",
      "    solution: \"Mitochondria are often referred to as the ''powerhouses'' of cells because they make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell’s main energy-carrying molecule. They are bean-shaped structures each with a double membrane. Cellular respiration, the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients, occurs in mitochondria. This process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as waste. Muscle cells, for example, have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP, as they need considerable energy to keep the body moving.\",\n",

      "  {\n",
      "    question: \"What are peroxisomes and what is their function within a cell? How do they contribute to the detoxification process?\",\n",
      "    solution: \"Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids and detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. Many of these oxidation reactions release hydrogen peroxide, which would be damaging to cells; however, when these reactions are confined to peroxisomes, enzymes safely break down the hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol.\",\n",
