      "Teacher (to the student): Ribosome's are found in high numbers in cells that synthesize large amounts of protein, demonstrating how their form (high number) follows their function (protein synthesis).\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. They can be found floating freely in the cytoplasm or attached the cytoplasmic side or the endoplasmic reticulum's cytoplasmic side and nuclear envelope's outer membrane. They receive their orders for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes intomessenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, whicch translate the code provided by the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in the mRNA into specific order of amino acids linked together.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria are often called the \"powerhouses\" of cells because they make ATP, the cell's main energy carrying molecule.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria use a processcalled cellular respiration to make ATP. This process uses the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients and it requires oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as  a byprodduct. The carbon dioxide we exhale comes from these cellular reactions.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Muscle cells have a very high concentration of mitochondria that produce ATP. Your muscle cells need considerable energy to keep your body moving. When your cells don't get enough oxygen, they mae small amounts of ATP and aso produce lactic acid.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Peroxisome are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down ftty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. For example, perixisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol. Glyoxysomes, which are specialized perixisomes in plants, are responsible for converting stored fats into sugars.\n",

      "Teacher (to the student): ATP represents the ccell's short-term stored energy. Cellular respiration is the process of making ATP using the chemical energy in glucose and other nutrients. In mitochondria, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as waste.

      "Teacher (to the student): Of course!  \"Form follows function\" is an important adage in biology, and it basically means that a structure of the body has a specific shape because of what it does for the organism.  This happens everywhere, from the smallest cells to the largest creatures.  Ribosomes synthesize proteins, and they can be found, through no coincidence, in cells that require a lot of proteins, like the pancreas which produces important digestive enzymes. \n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Absolutely.  Ribosomes are cellular structures that sometimes group into clusters, or they may float freely in the cytoplasm of a cell.  They can also attach themselves to plasma membranes on either the inner or outer side.  Ribosomes create proteins from the materials present in a cell, and they do so automatically using mRNA to create a specific sequence of amino acids much like how an old computer uses a set of punch cards for instructions.  This simple setup can make an innumerable amount of amino acids that comprises the DNA of all living things!\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Absolutely.  Ribosomes are cellular structures that sometimes group into clusters, or they may float freely in the cytoplasm of a cell.  They can also attach themselves to plasma membranes on either the inner or outer side.  Ribosomes create proteins from the materials present in a cell, and they do so automatically using mRNA to link together a specific sequence of amino acids to form proteins, much like how an old computer uses a set of punch cards for instructions.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes receive their orders from mRNA, the \"m\" being short for \"messenger\".  This mRNA holds a set of instructions for how the ribosomes should link together amino acids to create a specific sequence in order to build proteins.  \n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Yes, mRNA is transcribed from DNA within the nucleus of a cell.  The mRNA is released from the nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where it floats freely until it is met by a ribosome, which can then use it to be translated into a sequence of amino acids.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): \"The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\" is the popular phrase many people remember from their school days, and it is very true!  The mitochondria makes ATP, which are molecules that the cell uses to store energy like a battery until it needs to use that energy.  ATP comes from chemical energy found in glucose and other nutrients, which come from the food we eat.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Great question - cellular respiration is the process of making ATP, and it works by using oxygen to create different molecules from the glucose and nutrients present in your cells.  A byproduct of this reaction is carbon dioxide, which is then released as a waste product through the lungs.  Cellular respiration is useful for cells that need a lot of energy, like muscle cells.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): I'm glad you remember that phrase!  Recall that \"form follows function\" means that a structure's use informs how it displays within an organism.  The fact that mitochondria appear often in muscle cells happens because those cells need a lot of energy to function properly.  Mitochondria produce a lot of energy, so the body stores mitochondria where it is needed most.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Perosixomes are small, round structures in cells that are enclosed by their own single membranes.  They also use oxidation, but they use it to break down fatty acids and amino acids into different molecules.  They also detoxify the body by removing unnecessary or harmful foreign molecules by releasing H2O2.  This chemical is known as \"peroxide\", which is where the structure gets its name.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Great question!  Peroxide is a very good chemical for breaking down molecules because of how reactive it is with most ions.  It's dangerous for the body, so enzymes exist in the cell to safely break down peroxide into oxygen and water.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Peroxisomes are found in every cell, but a good example of where they work best is in liver cells.  Alcohol is technically a poison, but liver cells can use peroxisomes to safely break it down and detoxify it so that the body can safely digest it.\n",

      "Teacher (to the student): The phrase \"form follows function\" in the context of cellular biology means that the structure of each cell is beneficial for optimizing effectiveness for the \"job\" the cell has. If the cell is meant to produce proteins, it will have a large number of ribosomes to enable that function. \n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Another example of \"form follows function\" in cellular biology is that muscle cells will have a large number of mitochondria because muscles need a large amount of energy, and mitochondria produce that energy. \n",

      "Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes in eukaryotic cells can either be grouped into clusters or floating freely in the cell's cytoplasm. Ribosomes have both large and small subunits, and are directed by tRNA and mRNA to produce ammino acids through peptide chains to create proteins.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes receive \"orders\" for protein synthesis from the nucleus by the nucleus translating DNA into messenger RNA that the organelle can interact with. The messenger RNA provides the \"instructions\" to the ribosomes to create the right ammino acids to produce different proteins.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes are located on either the plasma membrane side or the endoplasmic reticulum's side and the nuclear envelope's outer membrane. The nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus of the cell, which contains the DNA that is translated into mRNA. The mRNA travels through the cytoplasm and permeable membranes of the organelles into the ribosome subunits.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria use oxygen to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the \"fuel\" that the various organelles in the cell use to perform their functions. The mitochondria produce not only ATP, but also carbon dioxide which is disposed of by the body through exhaling. \n",
      "Teacher (to the student): The process of turning glucose and other nutrients into ATP with the help of oxygen is called \"cellular respiration.\" Like respiration with our lungs, the process uses oxygen and expels carbon dioxide. \n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Cellular respiration has three stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis is the process of turning the glucose into the first building blocks for ATP. \n",
      "Teacher (to the student): There is a high concentration of mitochondria in muscle cells because muscles require a lot of energy to function. Because mitochondria produce cellular energy, it makes sense that there are more of them in muscle cells so there is sufficient supply of energy for the muscles.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Peroxisomes are another type of organelle in eukaryotic cells. Fatty acids and amino acids cannot be broken down by the body without their oxidation reactions. In addition to those acids, peroxisomes also break down poisons so they cause less harm to the body. The oxidation process results in the waste product hydrogen peroxide, which is broken down further into oxygen and water by the enzymes inside peroxisomes. \n",
      "Teacher (to the student): One way peroxisomes detoxify poisons in the body is in the liver. Alcohol is a poison to the body, so the peroxisomes break it down into less harmful substances.\n",

      "Teacher (to the student): Ribosomes receive their orders for protein synthesis from the nucleus where the DNA transcribes into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels to the ribosomes, which translate the sequence of nitrogenous bases into a specific order of amino acids linked together. These amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria are bean-shaped structures with a double membrane, often called \"powerhouses\" because they make ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is the cell's main energy-carrying molecule and represents the cell's short term stored energy. You will often find a high concentration of mitochondria in muscle cells since they need considerable energy to keep the body moving.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Mitochondria use cellular respiration to make ATP using the chemical energy from glucose and other nutrients. This process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as waste. So every breath you exhale comes from cellular reactions that have carbon dioxide as waste, like mitochondria making ATP.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Your muscle cells require considerable energy to keep your body moving. When these cells don't get enough oxygen, they make small amounts of ATP and also produce lactic acid.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): Peroxisomes are small, round organelles enclosed by single membranes. They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty and amino acids. They also can detoxify the many poisons that enter the body. For example, peroxisomes in liver cells detoxify alcohol.\n",
      "Teacher (to the student): When the oxidation reactions are confined to the peroxisomes, the enzymes safely break down the H202 byproduct into oxygen and water.\n",
