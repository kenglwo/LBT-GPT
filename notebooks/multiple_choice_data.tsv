267d7527-a106-4103-bef6-4ba064cb0062	reading	Protein synthesis is necessary because it is important in order for other parts of the cell to function, such as the mitochondria which produces ATP for energy.		
269f9bb0-3c4e-4733-9b1b-e1eb4aec001b	llm-qa-bot	Proteins are the building blocks of our body. Everyday, our muscles are breaking down on a microscopic level. By synthesizing proteins, our cells are able to replenish each other and even make new cells. Basically, it's how we grow. 		
313cfc2b-03e1-483a-b2fc-27090caa77db	teacher-qa-bot	It is necessary in the building and maintaining of cells in our body and example would be how we need ribosomes in large amounts in order to synthesize proteins so that our cells can create the energy needed for our body to function properly. 		
331f36f9-8f2d-412a-bab7-939d27e171bd	llm-chatbot	It is a crucial process in our body because proteins play a fundamental role in nearly every aspect of our biology.

3ef9ed55-38bd-4ecc-af2c-fc98cb597aab	llm-qa-bot	Protein synthesis is crucial for the human body because proteins serve as essential molecules involved in various biological functions. Proteins provide structural support, act as enzymes for chemical reactions, transport molecules, regulate the immune system, function as hormones, enable muscle contraction, facilitate cell signaling, extract energy from nutrients, and aid in tissue repair and growth. Without protein synthesis, the body would be unable to carry out these vital processes, leading to severe health issues or even death.

In peroxisomes, oxidation reactions are carried out that break down fatty acids and amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, and we would be unable to get amino acids without protein synthesis in the first place. It's a cycle that builds on itself.		
754b1604-a02c-4ea4-93f8-0071a8ade5d1	reading	Protein synthesis ensures that our body can produce the diverse array of proteins needed for many critical functions, supporting overall health and function.  Antibodies are an example protein that defend against pathogens.		
810ed55e-4458-45fa-9cc8-8485d864becc	llm-qa-bot	Our body needs to be able to build the proteins that we need for certain, important functions.
