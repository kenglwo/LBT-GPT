1d3c5ef8	reading	('MRNA', 'protein which is used by the liver mainly ')			('Glucose', 'ATP')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			A cell has the capacity to alter its shape as well as its volume in response to need for altered force production. 			The pancreas and its cells are important for digesting food and managing your use of sugar for energy atfer digestion. If it gets out of wack you can get diabetes a very serious disease that can lead to loss of life			the catalase they contain.		
4a9770ff	reading	("I'm not sure", 'DNA')			('Carbon Dioxide', 'Not sure')			('Cells', 'Not sure')			An example was given about a building that has all these components inside like an elevator and furniture. Cells and inside structure follow a similar pattern.			I'm not sure how it works, I just know that cells in the pancreas are used to digest food I believe?			I'm honestly not really sure.		
cbcb5e82	reading	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('ATP', 'lactic acid')			('peroxisomes', 'chemical')			The principle "form follows function" is that for a given structure, its form is shaped by its function. The text gave the example of how an emergency room in a hospital must have easy access due to the need to transport patients directly and efficiently. The function, getting patients in and out quickly, shapes its form, having a clear and unobstructed path. When applying this principle to muscle cells, consider that muscle cells require much more energy than other cells in order to move. As a consequence muscle cells have a higher amount of mitochondria present in them (form) due to their need for ATP (function).			Since pancreas cells have the specialized task of creating proteins, they have much more ribosomes, the organelles that synthesize protein, than other cells. This is analogous to how muscle cells have more mitochondria than other cells.			Hydrogen peroxide is broken down into water and oxygen by peroxisomes, the cell organelles that break down fatty acids and amino acids.

f66e6d7c	reading	('Mrna', 'amino acids')			('hydrogen peroxide', 'H202')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			Form follows functions is like a skyscraper needs to include several elevator banks and hospitals need hospital rooms for patients			High numbers in eukaryotic cells that have large amounts of protein go into the pancreas which helps with ddigestive pancreas cells			ATP uses chemical energy in glucose uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as waste. 		
0ca07eae	teacher-qa-bot	('enzymes', 'cells')			('carbon ', 'hydrogen')			('eukarodic', 'detoxification')			Something is made or built in order to produce results and then how it looks is secondarily important.			They help to balance toxins.			The residuals become waste.		
64ce8de6	teacher-qa-bot	('MRNA', 'amino acids')			('Mitochondria', 'H2O2')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			A particular structure is specifically designed to help the structure carry out a particular function.			The Pancreatic have a high quantity of digestive enzymes that contain many ribosomes.			Because the reactions are confined to peroxisomes and safely break down H2o2 into oxygen and water.		
8b49d5c9	teacher-qa-bot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('H2O2', 'glucose')			('enzymes', 'photosynthesis')			A structure is designed to help the overall structure carry out it task. Muscle cells has many mitochondria that solely makes energy.			Pancreas cell specializes in detoxifying poisons and solely focuses on doing this task.			The body is adapted to functioning by specific processes and thus will not be harmed by H2O2, which gets disposed of by enzymes, and makes oxygen as a residual.		
c0da7f90	teacher-qa-bot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('Glucose', 'ATP')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidative')			The principle of "form follows functions" is that the structure of a biological component is related to its specific role. It applies to the structure of muscle cells because muscle cells have a cylindrical shape with many fibers that enable efficient contraction and relaxation for movement.			The structure of the digestive pancreas cells supports their particular function due to the abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum and vesicles, which allow the synthesis and release of digestive enzymes.			The cells are not damaged by hydrogen peroxide because they contain enzymes that rapidly break down H2O2 into water and oxygen. The residual products of this process are harmless and include water and O2, which are released safely from the cell.		
e551aa0d	teacher-qa-bot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('glucose', 'atp')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			Form follows function means that a structure is designed to do a function. 			Unknown			They are broken down by peroxisomes into carbon dioxide. 		
f0a281d1	teacher-qa-bot	('RNA', 'proteins')			('glucose', 'methane??')			('peroxisomes', 'oxidation')			It means building something's design based on that thing's purpose. Muscle cells have higher concentrations of ATP because they need extra energy. 			I don't remember reading about this, but I imagine these cells have extra ATP to break down sugar. 			H2O2 is contained within peroxisomes, which break down the H2O2 into oxygen (or water?) and hydrogen.

4cfd407b	llm-chatbot	('mrna', 'ATP')			('hydrogen', 'hydrogen')			('ribosomes', 'cellular respiration')			Form follows function means the design of something is designed around the action within. Muscle cells need to make a lot of ATP.  That is the function.  The form is the large amount of peroxosomes. to make protein.			They are a thin membrane that allows for respiration			The cell is not damaged because the cleansing is done safely within the peroxisome.		
6b624cca	llm-chatbot	('mRNA', 'amino acids')			('ATP', 'energy')			('peroxisomes', 'detoxification')			"Form follows function" means that a structure's role in the body informs where it will be and how it will be used.  Cells use this in a multitude of ways, including making it so that there are a lot of mitochondria in muscle cells, which need more energy than other cells.			The digestive cells in a pancreas work to break down glucose into smaller molecules, which helps to prevent it from going back into the bloodstream and to give the body energy.			H2O2, or peroxide, is very reactive with most molecules, but it is broken down by enzymes into water and oxygen.

cb2aec8c	llm-chatbot	('RNA', 'ribosomes')			('H202', 'oxygen')			('oxidation', 'cellular respiration')			The structure of the muscles cells (the form) is directly related to it's function.			Pancreas cells help with digestion.			The cell is not damaged because of cellular respiration, which protects from oxidation.
